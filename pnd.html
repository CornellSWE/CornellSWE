          The Cornell University Society of Women Engineers proudly presents our semiannual
	Professional Networking Dinner.  Held the evening before Cornell's technical career fair, 
	the Professional Networking Dinner enables company representatives and students to 
	interact in an intimate yet relaxed environment.  This allows representatives to share 
	personal and business experiences while seeing first-hand just what Cornell has to 
	offer.  Students have the opportunity to speak to representatives for an extended period 
	of time and to learn more about the workplace environment of many top engineering 
	companies. We cordially invite you to join us for this unique networking opportunity.
        <br /><br />
	<!-- Spring 2019 PND will be Tuesday, February 5th and company registration is now open! -->
	<!--The Fall 2018 PND date has yet to be decided. Please check back in September.-->

    <h4>Company Representatives</h4>
        <p>
	  	The event will cost $200.00 for the first company representative and $180.00 for each 
		additional representative. Please note that each company is limited to a maximum of 4 
		company representatives. Companies may also choose to purchase an advertisement 
		to be included in the program. Half page ads (5"x4") cost $50 and full page ads (5"x 
		8") cost $70. Dinner and four networking rotations will allow you to meet a wide variety 
		of students in a casual and friendly atmosphere. Representatives are invited to stay 
		an additional half hour, until 10:00pm, for further networking. This is a wonderful 
		opportunity to get to know potential full-time and internship applicants prior to the career 
		fair.

        <h4>Students</h4>
        <p>
          Tickets are $15 and may be purchased online with a credit card. The dinner consists of
          a four course meal catered by The Statler, with four rotations, during which you will be 
          able to network with different companies in a relaxed environment. Additionally, there 
          will be a short networking session prior to the start of the official rotations, and a thirty 
          minute networking session at the end of the night so that you will have the opportunity 
          to speak to any representatives that you may have missed, or would like to talk to again. 
          This is a great way to meet company reps and find a summer internship, co-op, or full 
          time job.
