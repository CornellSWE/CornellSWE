        <h4>Community Outreach</h4>
        <p>
          What makes Cornell University one of the best places to be? The surrounding Ithaca community that supports this wonderful institution and Cornell SWE tries give back! SWE Outreach engages with the community in various ways to raise awareness and more. 
          <br/><br/><strong>Community Outreach Liaisons</strong><br/>
          The Cornell community is truly a wonderful and diverse place with varying interest groups and many engaging minds. What better way is there then working together and sharing expertise to make a great impact on the community?
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Community Outreach Program Chairs</strong><br/>
          This section of the Outreach directorship works to make a lasting impression through recurring events. Some of these programs include the Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program (STOMP), Habitat for Humanity Women Builds, Lights Off Cornell!, and a new series of outreach podcasts which we hope to pilot this year.
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Community Outreach Event Chairs</strong><br/>
          What better way to incite diverse and unique tastes than with a variety of different activities? The Event Chairs work to organize various one-day events where the community can engage in science and engineering. The Event Chairs organize an annual trip to the Ithaca Sciencenter.

      <h4>Girl Scout Outreach</h4>
        <p>
          With our Junior Girl Scout and Brownie Girl Scout committees, SWE Outreach hopes to incite young girl scouts in the Ithaca area by bringing them to campus for a fun filled day. Through different hands on activities, the girls earn a “Try-It” or Jr. badge and explore problem solving and engineering. It’s a great way to interact with each other and work on team building. There is even a segment of the program designed for the parents with our local professional Twin Tiers Sections comes and speaks with the parents.

      <h4>School Outreach</h4>
        <p>
          At school, we not only learn about American history and adverbs but interact with others and mature. SWE Outreach hopes to further this personal growth by helping students find what they might like to do in the future. With our enthusiasm about engineering, we want to encourage students to pursue further education in science, math, and engineering.
          <br/><br/><strong>Elementary School</strong><br/>
          Reaching out to our youngest audience, we hope to pique their interest at a young age in fun and exciting activities. We hope to visit them and teach them all about science without them even knowing! We visit their classrooms and bring hands on activities.
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>High School</strong><br/>
          High School is the place where decisions are made and we hope to positively interact with students in class rooms to encourage them to move break up the lectures and book studies with hands on activities.
