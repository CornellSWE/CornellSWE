        <h4>Conference</h4>
	  <p style="text-align:center">In September 2019, only one of Forbes’ one hundred innovative leaders was a woman (“America’s Most Innovative Leaders”). Throughout history, women have been breaking boundaries in technology, but recognition has been few and far between. Lack of recognition has left young girls and aspiring women without role models, thus contributing to the gender gap in technical fields. With this book, we hope to increase visibility of female leaders and showcase the breadth of work women have accomplished through technical backgrounds. We believe diversity of thought is critical to innovation and is something to be celebrated.</p>
	  <p style="text-align:center">As graduating seniors of Cornell University’s College of Engineering, we set out to commemorate Cornell alumnae who inspire us during our transition to impactful careers in technology. We are confident that these stories will continue to inspire us throughout our lives and, moreover, inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.</p>
	  <p style="text-align:center">All proceeds support the Cornell Society of Women Engineers' K-12 outreach initiatives to advance STEM education and inspire future leaders.</p>
