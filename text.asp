          The Cornell University Society of Women Engineers proudly presents our semiannual Professional Networking Dinner. We cordially invite you to join a talented and eager group of students in this unique networking opportunity. Held the evening before Cornell's technical career fair, the Professional Networking Dinner enables company representatives and students to interact in an intimate yet relaxed environment. This allows representatives to share personal and business experiences while seeing first hand just what Cornell has to offer.
