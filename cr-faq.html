		<p><a name="besttimes"><b>Q: When are the best times to hold an information session?</b></a></p>
		<p>A: Classes officially end at 4:25pm each day. Career Services would like to standardize session times, and so we will be offering sessions at 4:30pm, 6:00pm, and 7:30pm. For engineers, Tuesday and Thursday evenings are preliminary exam nights. To avoid possible conflicts, please see the <a href="https://registrar.cornell.edu/Sched/PRELF.html">fall exam schedule</a> or <a href="https://registrar.cornell.edu/Sched/PRELS.html">spring exam schedule.</p></a>

	<br />

      	<p><a name="attendance"><b>Q: How do I gauge the anticipated attendance at a session?</b></a></p>
		<p>A: Although we can provide you with a number, we feel that it is better for companies to anticipate their attendance as you will know best what your turnout would be. The average number of students is typically 30. The base prices for the refreshment options are 
		determined by this average number.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="patchcord"><b>Q: What is a patchcord?</b></a></p>
        <p>A: The LCD projectors available here utilize serial port connections. If your laptop does not have a serial port, a patchcord is necessary. This adapter serves as a connection from the available port on your laptop to the serial cable of the projector.
		We do not provide a patchcord, and we request that you bring one.</p>

	<br />

		<p><a name="cancel"><b>Q:When is the latest I can cancel?</b></a></p>
        <p>A: One week prior notice to SWE at swecis@cornell.edu is required for cancellations. Cancellations made 7 days or less than the date of the session will result in a charge of half of the base price of a session. Less than 24 hours notice will result in a charge for the full price of the session. If you cancel at least 7 days prior to your scheduled info session, you will be refunded in full.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="roomchange"><b>Q: Why did my room resevation change from what was confirmed?</b></a></p>
        <p>A: Professors who make requests for academic purposes have priority over any other type of reservation. If such an event happens, we will find the next available location in closest proximity to the original reservation. We will send out emails and announcements to 
		students about the location change. Additionally, we will post signs and have a liaison to redirect students to your new session location the day of your session.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="closed"><b>Q: Can I opt to have a closed session for selected interviewees only?</b></a></p>
        <p>A: Yes. We will not advertise your session around campus. Since Engineering Career Services has the list of interviewees, we will notify them of your request and make sure it is not publicly advertised through them either.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="paymentdue"><b>Q: When is payment due?</b></a></p>
		<p>A: Payment is due one to two weeks after info sessions.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="paymenthow"><b>Q: How do I pay?</b></a></p>
		<p>A: Please write a check payable to the Cornell Society of Women Engineers and send to: 146 Olin Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14853. Please specify that the check is for an information session. You may also pay via credit card with our <a href="http://www.swe.cornell.edu/cr_payment.asp">online payment option</a>. For tax and federal ID, please email us at swecis@cornell.edu.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="confirmation"><b>Q: How soon can I expect a confirmation after I submit my request?</b></a></p>
        <p>A: Within a week. We will work on getting your request processed as soon as possible. Turnaround time can be as early as 24 hours.</p>
		
	<br />

		<p><a name="latest"><b>Q: When is the latest I can request to coordinate an information session with SWE?</b></a></p>
		<p>A:  In order for SWE to provide the highest quality service, all session details must be finalized at least one week prior to the desired date. Ordering food and reserving a room is never a problem, however, it does take one week for room requests to be processed and confirmed. At least a week is necessary to properly publicize an information session and ensure the session has sufficient number of liaisons and volunteers. Since session details may take several days to finalize - especially if you have any questions about the session options - we recommend that session requests are made at least 14 days prior to the desired date.</p>
